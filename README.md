# API Design with Node.js

### The Goal 

Learning how to design, build, test and deploy a resful API using node and mongoDB. End result of building and deploying an api for a blogging app with authentication. 

### The Reason

API's are used quite frequently in application development. Back-end developers usually work on api's to give to Front-end developers for implementation. I LOVE to know how everything works together and what it takes to get certaon tasks done - - this also makes for better team collaboration as it helps to be more considerate with the timeframe and deadlines each team player faces. On my transformation / Journey in becoming a QUALITY Front-end developer I continue to keep myself well-rounded in ALL aspects of development... This is one of my steps.


### The Install Process 
Stay Tuned. Project is still WIP


### The Aftermath
Stay tuned for my opinions and lessons on using these tools.

### The Feedback
Keep in mind that this was made for further understanding and hands on practice in working with API's.
 I'm passionate and eager in my continued education in development and open to any and all feedback. Feel free to contact me by visiting my site:
